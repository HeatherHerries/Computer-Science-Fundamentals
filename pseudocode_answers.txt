Short Answer

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

A: Pseudocode is an informal language that helps programmers 
to develop algorithms. It is a way to express what code 
should do without using a particular language's syntax. 
Pseudocode is meant for humans to read rather than machines, 
so it will not run on a computer. It is brainstorming before 
you begin to code your program.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

A: It would produce an error. Pseudocode is meant for humans 
to read not machines, so it will not run on a computer.



Programming Assignment

Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out 
the greater number.

A: 
Input first number
Input second number
If first number is greater than second number
   Print first number
Else if first number is less than second number
   Print second number
End If

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

A:
Init number to 0
While number is < 100
   increase number by 1
End while
Return number

    
3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a 
phonebook.

A:  
Input name
If name === name in phonebook
   return phonbook name information
Else
   return no match
End if

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, 
implement it in any computer language of your choice.

A:
function findName(name){
	var phonebook = ['Heather', 'Kourtney', 'Madeline'];
	for (var i = 0; i < phonebook.length; i++){
	if (phonebook[i] === entry) {
		return "We found:" + " " + name;
	  } else {
		return "No name found";
	   }
	findEntry('Heather');
